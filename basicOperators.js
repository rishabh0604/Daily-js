/*Javascript operators are symbols which are used to assign values, compare values,  perform arthematic operations and more.Javascript

>> The variables(operations) are called operands.
>> The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.*/

// Addition
//The addition operator is denoted by '+'. It is used to add two or more numbers and returns their sum as the output.

let num1 = 25; 
let num2 = 36;
let num3 = 55;

let sum = num1 + num2 + num3;
console.log(sum);  // ouyput : 116


// Subtraction
//The subtraction operator is denoted by '-'. It is used to subtract one number from another and returns their difference as the output.

let number1 = 25;
let number2 = 35;

let diff = number1 - number2;
console.log(diff);  //output : -10


// Multiplication
//The multiplication operator is denoted by '*'. It is used to multiply one number from another and returns their product as the output.

let num4 = 5;
let num5 = 6;

let prod = num4 * num5;
console.log(prod);  // Output : 30


// Exponential
//The exponentiation operator is denoted by '**'. This operator raises the first operand to the power of second operand.
 
let x = 2;
let y = 5;

let ans = x ** 3;
console.log(ans);  //Output : 8

ans = x ** y;
console.log(ans);  // Output :32

//Division
//The division operator is denoted by '/'. It is used to divide one number by another and returns their quotient as the output.

let a = 10;
let b = 3;

let sol = a/b;
console.log(sol);  // Output :3.33333


//Modulus
//The modulus operator is denoted by '%'. It returns the division remainder i.e. the remainder of two numbers that have been divided.

let mod1 = 10;
let mod2 = 4;

let remain = mod1 % mod2; 
console.log(remain);
//Output : 2
